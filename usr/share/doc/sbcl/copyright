 Steel Bank Common Lisp (SBCL) is free software, and comes with
 absolutely no warranty.
 .
 SBCL is derived from CMU CL, which was released into the public
 domain.
 .
 After CMU CL was released into the public domain, it was maintained by
 volunteers, who continued the tradition of releasing their work into
 the public domain.
 .
 All changes to SBCL since the fork from CMU CL have been released into
 the public domain in jurisdictions where this is possible, or under
 the FreeBSD licence where not.
